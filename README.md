# Tamandua
This program will notify the students in the University of California, Irvine (UCI) when the classes they want is open.

## Background
Enrolling classes that the students want is often a difficult task in the University of California, Irvine. This is largely due to the server's inability to handle a large amount of requests. Numerous tools attempt to register for classes have been created. However, it has shown that usually programs like these can be abused. Recently, there are reports indicate that some students will use these tools to keep making requests that ultimately overload the server, rendering the service incapable of adding students' classes. Consequently, class registration is not the focus of this project. Instead, this project will focus on class registration **NOTIFICATION**. It will tell the students to get the classes they want once they are open. The method of registering the classes will be students' choice. However, I recommend that students should use Webreg as the primary choice of performing this task because it is the legal and official way as specified by the registrar.

There is also another reason behind this project's motivation. Most applications, such as Coursicle, are mobile-focused; in other words, PC is not their targets. As a result, PC users will face difficulty to automate checking class availability. This tool essentially performs the same task as Coursicle with the exception that both PC and other mobile devices like smartphones are supported.

## Naming
In the University of California, Irvine, Anteaters are the official mascot representing the school itself. If one can search the meaning of "Tamandua," he or she can find that "Tamandua" is the formal name for "Anteater." In order to echo the academic background of this project and to avoid others' tendency to name their projects with prefix such as "Zot" or "Ant," I decided to use "Tamandua" as the name for my work.
