# Tamandua
This program will notify the students in the University of California, Irvine (UCI) when the classes they want is open.

## Naming
In the University of California, Irvine, Anteaters are the official mascot representing the school itself. If one can search the meaning of "Tamandua," he or she can find that "Tamandua" is the formal name for "Anteater." In order to echo the academic background of this project and to avoid others' tendency to name their projects with prefix such as "Zot" or "Ant," I decided to use "Tamandua" as the name for my work.
